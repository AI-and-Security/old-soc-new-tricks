    "## Exercise 1: Exploring Attack Surface Management Data with Pandas and Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to import and analyze an **Attack Surface Management (ASM)** dataset. This dataset is something that a vulnerability management analyst will encounter in their day-to-day role.\n",
    "We'll use **pandas** for data manipulation and **seaborn** for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's the story?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a new analyst in your security operations center. As a new member of the team, you have been asked to explore the **attack surface** of your organization. The **attack surface** is the set of points on the boundary of a system, a system element, or an environment where an attacker can try to enter, cause an effect on, or extract data from, that system, system element, or environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of an organization's security team, it is usually a great idea to have an understanding of what you are trying to keep secure-- your data, assets, and even your personnel! We will explore the assets in your organization as part of this exercise. This is the first step in many data science exercises-- data exploration!\n",

    "### Key Questions:\n",
    "- What is the distribution of risk levels in my environment?\n",
    "- How many assets are in the cloud vs. on-prem?\n",
    "- Which services are most exposed?\n",
    "- How does vulnerability severity vary across risk levels?"
